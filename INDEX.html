                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Ruby:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ruby is a programming language focused on simplicity and productivity.</li>
                    <li>Wondering why Ruby is so popular? Its fans call it a beautiful, artful language. And yet, they say it’s handy and practical.</li>
                    <li>It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</li>
                    <li>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.</li>
                    <li>Ruby is also completely free. Not only free of charge, but also free to use, copy, modify, and distribute.</li>
                    <li>The Ruby programming language is most commonly used with the Ruby on Rails framework. </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Rails:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. </li>
                    <li>t allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</li>
                    <li>If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails.
                    <br>
                    Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles
                      <ul>
                        <li><em>Don't Repeat Yourself:</em> DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
                        <li><em>Convention Over Configuration:</em> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> This track establishes the foundations for learning real-world technologies used by programmers on the job.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Why this is the best track for you:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You like the idea of a language built with the idea of syntax that keeps elegance and simplicity in mind</li>
                    <li>Want to work with the Ruby framework that focuses on the principle of doing more with less</li>
                    <li>Simplicity and DRY principle mean the software should be less buggy and yet more managable.</li>
                    <li>You are intersted in developing primarily web application development. </li>

            <p class="panel-title">CSS/React Track </p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>CSS</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work.</li>
                    <li>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers.</li>
                    <li>The Importance of CSS in Web Development. CSS is an integral part of the modern web development process. It is a highly effective HTML tool that provides easy control over layout and presentation of website pages by separating content from design.</li>
                    <li>HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.</li>
                    <li>CSS is different than most programming languages. HTML is a markup language and CSS is a style sheet language.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>React</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>React (sometimes React.js or ReactJS) is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
                    <li>It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.</li>
                    <li>React does not attempt to provide a complete 'application framework'. It is aimed squarely at building user interfaces, and therefore does not include many of the tools some developers consider necessary to build an application. </li>
                    <li>This allows the choice of whichever libraries the developer prefers to accomplish tasks such as performing network access or local data storage. Common patterns of usage have emerged as the library matures.</li>
                    <li>The big idea behind React is this: <em>what if you could create your own HTML element that has customized functionality?</em> </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Why this is the best track for you:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>UI is your focus</li>

                    <li>Style and customization is important to you, CSS is perfect for making your web pages specific to your designs in terms of layout, presentation, and focusing on design over content.</li>
                    <li>You like the idea of using the React library, as it is maintained by a large corporation like Facebook, and has recently switched to the MIT license.</li>
