                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Ruby:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ruby is a programming language focused on simplicity and productivity.</li>
                    <li>Wondering why Ruby is so popular? Its fans call it a beautiful, artful language. And yet, they say it’s handy and practical.</li>
                    <li>It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</li>
                    <li>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.</li>
                    <li>Ruby is also completely free. Not only free of charge, but also free to use, copy, modify, and distribute.</li>
                    <li>The Ruby programming language is most commonly used with the Ruby on Rails framework. </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4"><strong>Rails:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. </li>
                    <li>t allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</li>
                    <li>If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails.
                    <br>
                    Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles
                      <ul>
                        <li><em>Don't Repeat Yourself:</em> DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
                        <li><em>Convention Over Configuration:</em> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> This track establishes the foundations for learning real-world technologies used by programmers on the job.</li>

                    <li>Want to work with the Ruby framework that focuses on the principle of doing more with less</li>
                    <li>Simplicity and DRY principle mean the software should be less buggy and yet more managable.</li>
